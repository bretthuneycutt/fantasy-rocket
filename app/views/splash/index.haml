          %h4 2. Draft your teams
          %p We randomly assign each player a number that determines draft order. Each player picks the NFL teams they think will win the most games until there are no teams left. We use our special algorithm to determine when each player gets to draft in order to even the probability fairly.

          %h4 3. Win
          %p The highest number of victories for those three teams wins the pool. Enjoy a season full of competition with your friends.
